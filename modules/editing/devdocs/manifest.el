"Installs Devdocs integration for programming modes

- `devdocs-lookup' will be bound to \"C-h D\"

- Predefined documentation packages will be automatically set up
  for some well-known prorgramming major modes, such as Python or
  HTML

- The mappings can be customised by adjusting the value of
  `devdocs-major-mode-to-docs-alist' appropriately (please see
  its docs for all the options)

- Any documents not yet installed will be automatically scheduled
  for installation when Emacs is idle the first time the
  corresponding major mode is launched"
